LMARVEL.m : L-MARVEL Algorithm <br>
Main.m : This file loads a dataset from a real-world structure in the presence of latent variables, and calls the LMARVEL function <br>
Mb_TC.m: Compute the Markov boundaries using TC algorithm <br>
CI_tests.m: Checks the conditional independencies (CI) tests for linear-Gaussian models <br>
Learning-errors.m: Compute the accuracy of the learned graph
